Search &amp; Rescue Robot

Robotics final project utilizing autonomous pathfinding, relative and absolute position control, and beacon frequency filtering and detection.

Note: The majority of the code found on this top layer is written by me (with the help of my team members).
Code found in the src folder was written entirely by my instructure in order to configure the background environment.
(this includes things like setting up WIFI, configuring certain peripherals, etc.)
